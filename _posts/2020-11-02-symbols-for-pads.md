While using "Pads" (like [etherpad lite](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite), [cryptpad](https://cryptpad.fr) etc.) or other poor text editors you sometimes might need symbols
to indicate lists, important items, separate sections and other stuff. This is
the beginning of a collection of mine.

> Copy and paste them as you like

For technical reference: these are UTF-8 symbols and will probably not be
supported by real legacy software.
