At github you can have jekyll generated sites for your repositories and they
will be published at `<whatever>.github.io`. In your repositories settings you
can select the branch from which the site is built or served.

However for `<username>.github.io` pages, stuff has to be served from your
`master` branch.

[jekyll-github-deploy](https://github.com/yegor256/jekyll-github-deploy) (jgd) is a shell-script wrapper that makes building
your site locally and pushing the result into the master branch easy:

```bash
jgd --branch-from=source --branch=master
```

(That means that your jekyll sources are to be found in another branch)

Unfortunately, the `README.md` is removed from the master branch (where you
"deploy" your site into), but that is the branch that is shown by default when
people browse the repo. [We are working on that, though](https://github.com/yegor256/jekyll-github-deploy/issues/32).
