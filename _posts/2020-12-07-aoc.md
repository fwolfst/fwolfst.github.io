This year I decided to spend some time on the [Advent of
code](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

I will use my as-of-today favorite programming language, Ruby.

I am not a [Code golfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) and my goal
was strictly do **get the solution** while writing code that still can be
explained somewhat.

I don't think that I will revisit my solutions and so far I consider the code
relatively clean, allthough not performant or always elegant wrt to the Ruby
Standard Library.

Nevertheless, so far it is a fun experience and I'd be glad to join a Private
Leaderboard next year. Give me a shout if you'd enjoy doing that in 2021.

My solutions are [on github](https://github.com/fwolfst/aoc).
