These pages constitute my blog and experiment with Jekyll.

My name is Felix Wolfsteller, I live in the ecovillage project "[Sieben
Linden](https://siebenlinden.org)" in the north of Germany.

Besides many labels, I am often referred to as hardcore IT-expert. In that role
I enjoy the Ruby programming language and its ecosystem.

Open Source and why.

You can find out more info about Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/). Its code is at [https://github.com/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll).
